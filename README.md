# KeyboardSpecialCharacters (Windows only)
This script is used as an alternative to the standard US-International Keyboard Layout for italian speakers.

To see the complete list of supported characters scroll down.

### Why this exists?
While switching to another keyboard layout (IT -> US) I noticed that the only way for me to get some of the characters I usually use in the italian language is to set the US layout to "International".

Though this adds many international characters and symbols, as an italian native speaker I know I don't need most of them.
Additionally I struggled to get used to the way that this keyboard layout manages backticks, single and double quote inputs, since it waits for another character input before deciding which character to print. 

So, for example, clicking the single quote key doesn't do anything unless you press another character, and for this reason this makes printing a single double quote, single quote or backtick a pain because every time you have to press both the character key and the spacebar as if to say "I don't want any other character after this one".

Given all these problems, coding with the US international layout is *painful*.
